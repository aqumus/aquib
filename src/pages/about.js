          I have started my career as a "System Engineer" where I was
          configuring Mainframe Server, network switches and storages for Data
          Center primarily used as high availability nodes but then soon
          realised my passion for coding and development which got me turned
          into a Web Developer.

        <p>
          Beside learning about new technologies like machine learning and
          blockchain, my area of interest includes to be more well versed in
          backend technologies i.e creating web servers and system design, which
